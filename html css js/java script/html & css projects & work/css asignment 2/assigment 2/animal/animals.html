    <p>
        f you're worried about your carbon footprint, its better to own a cat than a dog. A 2009 study found
         that the resources needed to feed a dog over the course of its life create the same eco-footprint as
          that of a Land Cruiser. Meanwhile, cats—which eat less in general and are more likely to eat fish 
          than corn- or beef-flavored products—only have the approximate carbon footprint of a small hatchback.
